Selection criteria   There are three selection criteria that will be used to evaluate the eligibility of proposals submitted to the 2024  Nordforsk-led International Initiative on Sustainable Development of the Arctic call to receive NFRF funding:   •  Equity, diversity and inclusion in research practice and support of early career researchers  •  High reward  •  Feasibility   For more information:   Visit the NFRF International – NordForsk web page. It supports Discovery research projects that would significantly benefit from being assessed by a tri- agency interdisciplinary peer review committee, and aims to:   •  answer NSE research questions that are best addressed through interdisciplinary approaches  •  advance NSE disciplines through cross fertilization and new ways of thinking about research questions; ideas  and frameworks; approaches and methods; platforms, tools and infrastructure; people, partners and trainees   •  provide leading-edge NSE training for highly qualified personnel (HQP) in interdisciplinary research   environments   Subject matter eligibility   An eligible proposal must meet both of the following criteria:   •  •   Its primary objective must be to advance knowledge in the NSE  It must integrate or transcend disciplines in ways that would significantly benefit from peer review by a tri- agency interdisciplinary committee   Note that proposals that solely rely on the use of existing NSE methods and/or tools, while not advancing knowledge  within an NSE field are not eligible for Discovery Horizons. General eligibility principles   DGs are awarded to individual researchers, normally for five years. Subject matter eligibility and funding from other sources   Applicants to the DG program must present a program of research that is eligible under NSERC’s mandate, which is to  promote and assist research in the natural sciences and engineering, other than health. Eligibility   To encourage projects that push the boundaries in terms of interdisciplinarity, proposals must be submitted by  research teams with at least two individuals. To meet the minimum requirement to be considered interdisciplinary, a proposed research project must combine  elements from at least two different disciplines (as defined by a group-level classification based on the Canadian  Research and Development Classification). Projects that integrate two disciplines with a long and established tradition  of working together (e.g., biology and chemistry or psychology and education) may satisfy the above requirement but  not meet the expectations of the program. Selection criteria   There are five selection criteria for funding opportunities offered under the NFRF program.</td>

Eligibility   To encourage projects that push the boundaries in terms of interdisciplinarity, proposals must be submitted by  research teams with at least two individuals. To meet the minimum requirement to be considered interdisciplinary, a proposed research project must combine  elements from at least two different disciplines (as defined by a group-level classification based on the Canadian  Research and Development Classification). Projects that integrate two disciplines with a long and established tradition  of working together (e.g., biology and chemistry or psychology and education) may satisfy the above requirement but  not meet the expectations of the program.
